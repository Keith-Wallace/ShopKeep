#ShopKeep JavaScript Code Challenge
ShopKeep has been talking to business owners who wish to keep track of their Stock Items.
These business owners note that, for each Stock Item, they would need to have the following
information:
- **Name:** The name of the Stock Item to be added
- **Description:** A description of the Stock Item
- **Price:** How much the customer pays for the Stock Item
- **Available Date:** When this Stock Item is available within the store. The business owner can set
this value to be in the future if need be
- **Taxable:** Whether or not the Stock Item has tax applied when purchased

## Application Scenarios
The business owners detailed the following scenarios they would need to perform:

Scenario 1:
```
As a Business Owner
I want to be able to view my existing Stock Items
So that I can see what Stock Items my shop stocks
```

Scenario 2:
```
As a Business Owner
I want to be able to add a new Stock Item
So that I can keep track of additional Stock Items as they are added to my store
```

As an engineer, you have been tasked to write a frontend to implement the scenarios detailed
above. Your implementation should be extensible and allow us, in the future, to persist and
hydrate the application data from a remote server - that server interaction is not required for this
solution.

In order to gain an insight into the decisions you have made whilst developing this application,
please also make note of any assumptions and choices made. Is your solution scalable?
Maintainable? Are there potential pain points? Is it architecturally sound?

Though at ShopKeep we use React in our front-end development, please feel free to use any
available open-source frameworks and libraries, as required.
